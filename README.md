### AdventOfCode

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a free (donation-based) yearly game designed and maintained by author [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/).

Each day from December 1 to December 25 (Christmas day), two coding challenges are released at midnight. The word problems weave together into a larger story of you, the programmer, helping to save Christmas from technological destruction.

Here are my Python 3 solutions to subsets of the challenges from 2018 - present. Here's hoping this is the year I keep it up until Christmas!
